        Greetings, I&#39;m Ali Heydari. I&#39;m a front-end developer with a
        some experience in back-end development and DevOps. I build, maintain,
        and design websites and web applications. I&#39;ve been coding for over{" "}
        {new Date().getFullYear() - new Date(2020, 0, 1).getFullYear()} years
        and I&#39;m always looking to learn new things.
        <br />
        I entered Chemical Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology on
        2015. But I was always interested in coding and web development. So I
        changed my major to Computer Engineering at the Iran University of
        Science and Technology on 2016. I graduated on 2020 and started working
        as a front-end developer.
        <br />
        Besides coding, I also enjoy cooking and baking. I&#39;m not really good
        at it, but I love to experiment with new recipes. I really like
        astronomy I think knowing about the universe and the stars is really
        cool and destroys ego.
        <br />I like to play video games and watch movies and TV shows. You can
        find my favorite movies and series on

        I&#39;m almost always listening to music. When I&#39;m code, drive, or
        the house chores. Also I like to listen to podcasts. You can find my
        favorite musics and podcasts on
