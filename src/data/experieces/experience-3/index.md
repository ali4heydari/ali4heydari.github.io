A project funded by Iran's National Elites Foundation and supervised by [Prof. Behroozi](http://ee.sharif.edu/~behroozi/) and [Prof. Soleymani](http://sharif.edu/~soleymani/).

My Responsibilities include:

- Carrying out team coordination and work
- Meeting with hospital, clinic, and laboratory managers for requirements engineering and data gathering.
- We developed a follow-up automation software that is used in the process of discharging patients and can help hospitals and clinics stay in touch with their patients and coordinate the next check ups of the patient. It also provides the patients with educational content. This system is currently being used by Sina hospital.
