- Designing, implementing, and documenting programming assignments. You can find the assignments, along with their documentation, [here](https://sauleh.github.io/ap97/assignments/).
- Conducting weekly practice classes and workshops on topics such as Git, Azure DevOps, clean code, and WPF.
- Designing, implementing, documenting, and scoring programming exams. The exams, along with their corresponding answers, can be accessed [here](https://sauleh.github.io/ap97/assignments/).
