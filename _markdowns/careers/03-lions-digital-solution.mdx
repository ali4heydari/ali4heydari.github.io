It was my first remote job experience.
We worked on a statistic dashboard for Amazon sellers called ClearSight.
It works with the Amazon API to fetch data, Scraping and display it in a nice way and help sellers make better decisions.
I worked on the front-end part of the project such as landing page and dashboard using React, Ant design, and Typescript.
Although the project discontinued, It was a great experience to work on it.
