I had the privilege of being a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Advanced Programming course, supervised by [Prof. Sauleh Eetemadi](https://sauleh.github.io/). During my time as a TA, I had various responsibilities, including:

- Designing, implementing, and documenting programming assignments to enhance students' understanding of advanced programming concepts.
- Holding weekly practice classes to provide additional guidance and support to students, helping them improve their programming skills.

Working as a TA in this course allowed me to contribute to the learning experience of students and share my knowledge in the field of advanced programming.
It was a rewarding experience to see students grow and succeed in their programming journey.
