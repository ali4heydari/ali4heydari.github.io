Currently, I'm working on mostly crypto related projects.
I have a chance to work with the latest technologies and learn a lot about the crypto world.
Here are some of work I've done so far:

- Maintained CRM, Referral dashboard, client/admin dashboard, and developed DApp for a cryptocurrency exchange
- Developed Landing sites using *Directues* and *NextJS* with **90+ lighthouse score**
- Integrated **Sentry** with 15+ Front-end projects with readable stack trace by uploading and connecting sourcemaps on Sentry dashboard
- Wrote **modular** OpenAPI specifications for existing API from network request and responses 
- Developed client TypeScript SDK generation with **customized TypeScript parser**, **React Query** and **Zod** as runtime validation
- Improved code quality by applying more **ESLint rules**
- Integrated code metric tools such as **Code coverage** and **Type coverage**
- Wrote **Unit tests** and **Storybooks** for react components and end-to-end test using **Cypress** based on Page Object pattern
