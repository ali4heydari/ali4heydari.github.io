I had the opportunity to work on a project funded by Iran's National Elites Foundation, which was supervised by
[Prof. Behroozi](http://ee.sharif.edu/~behroozi/) and [Prof. Soleymani](http://sharif.edu/~soleymani/).
During this project, my responsibilities included:

- Carrying out team coordination and work
- Meeting with hospital, clinic, and laboratory managers for requirements engineering and data gathering.

As part of the project, we developed a follow-up automation software that is used in the process of discharging patients.
This software helps hospitals and clinics stay in touch with their patients and coordinate the next check-ups.
Additionally, it provides patients with educational content. Currently, this system is being used by Sina hospital.
