# Introduction
It was about a year ago that was thinking about answer of this question: "What are the jobs that I like to do not for money but for fun?"
I loved flowers, and I was always interested in floral design. A random day I saw a story on Instagram about a floral design workshop from [Hanna flower shop](https://hannaflower.shop), and I decided to attend the workshop.


# Hanna Flower Shop
Hanna Flower Shop is a local flower shop that offers a variety of services, including floral design, plant sales, bakery, and more.
It was founded by two sisters, Nazanin and Qazal, who are passionate about flowers and have a keen eye for design on 2018.
At first, they started their business in their home, but as their popularity grew, they decided to open a physical shop in the west of Tehran in Shahran neighborhood.
Now, The shop moved to a bigger place in Shahrak-e-Gharb neighborhood. Nazanin immigrated to Canada and she recently opened a branch of [Hanna Flower Shop in Calgary, Alberta](https://www.instagram.com/hannaflower.ca) ðŸŽ‰

# The Workshop
The workshop was held in the shop's cozy studio, which was filled with an array of fresh flowers, greenery, and vases.
There were 4 participants, and we were each given a workstation with all the tools and materials we needed to create our own floral arrangement.

The workshop was led by Nazanin. At the first day she taught us about the basics of floral design, including color theory, composition, and flower care.
We learned how to select the right flowers and greenery for our arrangement, how to cut and arrange them in a vase, and how to create a balanced and visually appealing design.

On the second day, we put our new skills to the test and created our own arrangements.
Nazanin provided guidance and feedback as we worked, helping us refine our designs and make adjustments as needed.
We learned and practiced different techniques, such as one-sided, two-sided, rounded, and flower pot arrangements.

On the last day, We learned about designing for events and special occasions, such as weddings, parties, and holidays by Qazal.
We learned how to create a wedding bouquet, a plexiglas flower box, a flower crown and a flower wrist corsage.

I was amazed by how much I learned in just three days.
I had always admired floral designers and their ability to create beautiful arrangements, but I never realized how much thought and skill goes into the process.
designing with flowers is not just about putting flowers in a vase, it's about creating a work of art that evokes emotion and tells a story.

# After a Year
After a year I contacted Qazal and asked her to help me to create a flower arrangement for my girlfriend.
I wanted to create a special arrangement for my girlfriend's birthday, so I asked Qazal to help me choose the right flowers and design a unique arrangement.
I explained to her my ideas and preferences, and she helped to improve my design and select the perfect flowers and greenery.
The idea was to create a plexiglas flower box with a mix of red roses, eucalyptus, and an [Eve action figure](https://www.amazon.com/Character-Figures-Authentic-Storytelling-Collecting/dp/B07YT7JWPG) holding gift box in the middle.
It was my first time creating a plexiglas flower box, and I was a bit nervous about how it would turn out.
But with Qazal's guidance and expertise, the arrangement turned out beautifully, and my girlfriend loved it.
Beside the flower box, I also ordered a cake with a light green/yellow theme from their bakery, and I putted a small [WALL-E action figure](https://www.amazon.com/Character-Figures-Authentic-Storytelling-Collecting/dp/B07YT7JWPG) on the cake.

I was so happy with the final result, and it was a great feeling to see my girlfriend's reaction when she received the gift.
It was a small gesture, but it meant a lot to her, and it was a reminder of the joy and beauty that flowers can bring to our lives.

# Last words
I had a wonderful time at the floral design workshop and I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn from Nazanin and Qazal.
I plan to continue practicing my skills and experimenting with different styles and techniques.
Who knows, maybe one day I'll even start my own floral design business!
