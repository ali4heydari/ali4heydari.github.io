# Setup your development environment on your new Windows machine

Installing new applications and tools for first time after you buy a new Windows machine or reinstalled it's OS is a tedious task.
You have to go to each application's website, download the installer, run it, and follow the installation wizard (Next, Next, Next, ... ðŸ¥´).
This process is time consuming and boring, However, it's a must do task not only for developers but for any user.
Microsoft has introduced a new package manager called [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/package-manager/winget/) to automate this process.

## What is Winget?

Here is a quick guide to get you started with Winget.

- [Windows Package Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/) (aka WinGet) comes pre-installed with Windows 11 (21H2 and later).
  It can also be found in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1) or be [installed directly](ms-appinstaller:?source=https://aka.ms/getwinget).

- `winget list` shows all the applications that you currently have installed on your machine.
- `winget search <app-name>` searches for an application in the winget repository. You can use this command to find the exact name of the application you want to install.
- `winget install <app-name>` installs the application. You can use this command to install any application from the winget repository.
- `winget export` exports the list of all installed applications to a JSON file. This can be helpful if you want to see what you have installed if you are planning to reinstall your OS
  or buy a new machine.

You can install each app individually using the `winget install` command, but that's not the best way to do it if you have a long list of applications to install.
You can create a PowerShell script to automate the installation process.

### Option 1: export and import

If you already have a windows machine with all the applications you need installed, you can export the list of installed applications using the `winget export` command.

```powershell
# export the list of installed applications to a JSON file
winget export -o apps.json
```

This will create a JSON file with the list of all installed applications. You can use this file to install the same applications on another machine.

```powershell
# install all applications from the JSON file
winget import -i apps.json
```

Here you go, all your applications are installed on your new machine!

### Option 2: create a PowerShell script

If you don't have a machine with all the applications you need installed, you can create a PowerShell script to install all the applications you need.
Here is my script that installs some of the applications I use on my machine.

```powershell
Write-Output "`e[1;33mInstalling Apps`e[0m"

$apps = @(

)

foreach ($app in $apps) {
    $listApp = winget list --exact -q $app

    if (![String]::Join("", $listApp).Contains($app)) {
        Write-Host "`e[1;32mInstalling: $app`e[0m"
        winget install -e -h --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements --id $app
    } else {
        Write-Host "`e[1;34mSkipping: $app (already installed)`e[0m"
    }
}

```

Save this script as `install-apps.ps1` and run it using PowerShell.

Tada! All your applications are installed on your new machine!
