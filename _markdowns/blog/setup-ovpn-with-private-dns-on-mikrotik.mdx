# Introduction

The company that I work for has a private network that can only be accessed through VPN.
The VPN server is using OpenVPN. I have a MikroTik router at home and I want to setup OpenVPN client on it, so I can access the private network from home.
The problem is, the private network has a private DNS server that is not accessible from outside the network.
So I need to setup the MikroTik router to use the private DNS server when accessing the private network.

# Import OpenVPN client as PPP interface

First, we need to setup OpenVPN client as PPP interface.
Upload your `.ovpn` file to the router. You can use `Winbox` or `FTP` to upload the file.
Then go to `PPP` > `Interface`, Click on `Import .ovpn` button and select the .ovpn file that you got from the VPN server.

</center>

Now you should select the `.ovpn` in `File Name` dropdown. Then fill the `Private key passphrase` with the passphrase that you got from the VPN server and also
`OVPN Client User`, `OVPN Client Password` with the username and password that you got from the VPN server. Then click `Start` button.

> ![note]: `tls-auth` support
> My VPN server is using `tls-auth` which is not supported by "stable" versions of RouterOS.
> So I need to use "testing" version of RouterOS to be able to connect to the VPN server.
> From RouterOS 7.12beta2, `tls-auth` is supported. So if you got the same problem, you can try to upgrade your RouterOS to the latest testing version.

</center>

After successful import you will have a new PPP interface named `ovpn-import1699042054` or something like that
(I recommend to rename it to something more meaningful).
Also, VPN certificate will be added to the router's certificate list.
You can check imported certificates in `System` > `Certificates`
(rename the certificate to something more meaningful as well).

</center>

Enable the interface and check if it's connected. You can check the connection status in `PPP` > `Interface` > `ovpn-import1699042054` > `Status` tab.

</center>

<center>
  ![Status](/static/images/_markdowns/blog/setup-ovpn-with-private-dns-on-mikrotik/06-status.png)
</center>

Make sure you selected `Use Peer DNS` in `PPP` > `Interface` > `ovpn-import1699042054` > `General` tab.
This will add the DNS server that you got from the VPN server to the router's DNS list.
You can check the DNS list in `IP` > `DNS` > `Servers` tab as dynamic entries.

<center>
  ![DNS](/static/images/_markdowns/blog/setup-ovpn-with-private-dns-on-mikrotik/07-dns.png)
</center>

Moreover, you will have a new route in `IP` > `Routes` list. This route will route all traffic to the VPN server. You can check the route in `IP` > `Routes` list.

# Setup DNS

Now we need to setup DNS to use the private DNS server when accessing the private network.
Go to `IP` > `DNS` > `Static` tab and add a new static DNS entry. Fill the `Name` with the domain name that you want to resolve using the private DNS server.
For example `arr.lan`. Then select `Type` to `FWD` and check `Match Subdomains`. Then fill the `Forward to` with the IP address of the private DNS server that you
got from the VPN server, and you checked from `IP` > `DNS` > tab. Then click `OK` button.
Do this for all domain names and DNS IP addresses that you got from the VPN server.

  DNS](/static/images/_markdowns/blog/setup-ovpn-with-private-dns-on-mikrotik/09-static-dns.png)
</center>

Don't forget to check `Allow Remote Requests` in `IP` > `DNS` > `Settings` tab.
This will allow the router to resolve DNS requests from the private network.

> Consider that `FWD` will not work when you are using DoH (DNS over HTTPS). [Read more](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/DNS)

## Test DNS resolution

If you are using Windows, you can use `nslookup` command to test DNS resolution.
Open `cmd` and run `nslookup` command. Then type the domain name that you want to resolve.

```cmd
nslookup git.arr.lan
```

<center>
  ![nslookup](/static/images/_markdowns/blog/setup-ovpn-with-private-dns-on-mikrotik/10-nslookup.png)
</center>

If you are using Linux, or MacOS,
you can use `dig` command to test DNS resolution.
Open `terminal` and run `dig` command. Then type the domain name that you want to resolve.

```bash
dig git.arr.lan
```

If everything is ok, you should get the IP address of the domain name that you want to resolve.
