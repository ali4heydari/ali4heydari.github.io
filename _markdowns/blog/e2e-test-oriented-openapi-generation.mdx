# Introduction
I have been working on a project that not only doesn't have an OpenAPI specification 
but also doesn't have any end-to-end tests.
Every fetch function was written manually and tested manually.
Besides, There wasn't any end-to-end tests to test the flows.
I decided to write end-to-end tests and generate OpenAPI specification from them, 
But end-to-end tests and Open API generation are not looking related at first glance.
In this blog post, I will explain how I generated OpenAPI specification from end-to-end tests.


# Idea
The idea is simple: listening to the network requests and responses during the end-to-end tests and generating OpenAPI specification from them.
I used [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end tests and [Open API devtools](https://github.com/AndrewWalsh/openapi-devtools) for OpenAPI generation.
Open API devtools is a tool that generates OpenAPI specification from network traffic.
It can be used as a browser extension, So it can be used with Cypress. You need to install the browser extension and start recording the network traffic during the end-to-end tests.
I applied this idea to the [Cypress real world app](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app) project as proof of concept.
It's available on [My GitHub repository](https://github.com/ali4heydari/cypress-realworld-app)

## Other options:

### HAR to OpenAPI
You can use [HAR to OpenAPI](https://github.com/jonluca/har-to-openapi) to convert [HAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)) files to OpenAPI specification.
HAR is a JSON format for recording HTTP requests and responses and you can use it to record the network traffic.
Chrome and Firefox have built-in support for HAR files. You can export the HAR file from the browser devtools and convert it to OpenAPI specification.

### API git
[API git](https://app.apigit.com) is a website that generates OpenAPI specification from HAR files.
You can upload the HAR file to the website and it will generate the OpenAPI specification for you.
It uses git repository to store the OpenAPI specification.

# Steps
## Write end-to-end tests
First, you need to write end-to-end tests with Cypress.
You can use the following code snippet to start recording the network traffic.
```javascript
it(() => {
  // sample cypress code to test transaction page
  cy.visit("/user/transactions");
  
  // press search button
  cy.get("button[type=\"submit\"]").click();
  
  
});
```

## Install Open API devtools
First, you need to install Open API devtools browser extension. It supports chrome and firefox. 
Download the extension pack from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/AndrewWalsh/openapi-devtools/releases) and extract it somewhere in your project.
let's say `./cypress/tools/openapi-devtools/dist`.


## Load extension in Cypress
You need to load the extension in Cypress. You can use the following code snippet in your `cypress.config.ts` to load the extension.


```javascript cypress.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress';
import PluginEvents = Cypress.PluginEvents;
import PluginConfigOptions = Cypress.PluginConfigOptions;
import path from 'node:path';

export default defineConfig({
  defaultCommandTimeout: 10_000,
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
    experimentalRunAllSpecs: true,
    setupNodeEvents: (on: PluginEvents, config: PluginConfigOptions) => {
      on('before:browser:launch', (browser, browserLaunchDetails) => {
        if (browser.name === 'chrome') {
          const extPath = path.resolve(
            './cypress/tools/openapi-devtools/dist'
          );

          browserLaunchDetails.extensions.push(
            extPath
          );
        }

        return browserLaunchDetails;
      });
    },
  },
  requestTimeout: 20_000,
  viewportWidth: 1440,
  viewportHeight: 900,
});

```
Then, if you run cypress with `cypress open` command you must see the open api devtools tab in the browser devtools.

## Start recording and tests
Now you are ready to start recording the network traffic and run the tests. Just open the Cypress and open the Chrome browser devtools. 
You must have open api devtools on your browser devtools tabs. Click on the record button and run the tests.
After all test runs, you can stop the recording and download the OpenAPI specification. It will download the OpenAPI specification as a JSON file
in `cypress/downloads` folder with name `openapi-devtools-spec.json`.

## Make Open api modular
The generated OpenAPI specification may be too big and not modular. You can split the specification into multiple files and make it modular for further usage.
The good news is that you don't need to split it manually. You can use [Redocly](https://redoc.ly/) to split the OpenAPI specification into multiple files.

> I wrote another blog post about [code generation with OpenAPI](/blog/modular-openapi-first-code-generation)
> It explains how to generate client SDK and mock server from OpenAPI specification.

[Redocly](https://redoc.ly/) has a feature to split the OpenAPI specification into multiple files.
It split the OpenAPI specification based on the tags and paths and the format of the OpenAPI specification.
If you provide your OpenAPI specification in `.json` format it will split it into multiple `.json` files and same for `.yaml` format.
I prefer `.yaml` format for OpenAPI specification because it is more readable and easy to write.
Since `openapi-devtools` extension generates the OpenAPI specification in `.json` format, you need to convert it to `.yaml` format.
I use [bairesdev.com/tools/json2yaml](https://www.bairesdev.com/tools/json2yaml/) to convert the OpenAPI specification to `.yaml` format.

After converting the OpenAPI specification to `.yaml` format, Save the content to a file named `./cypress/downloads/openapi-devtools-spec.yaml`.
You can use the following command to split the OpenAPI specification.

For `.json` format:
```bash
yarn redocly split --separator / ./cypress/downloads/openapi-devtools-spec.json --outDir openapi
```

For `.yaml` format:
```bash
yarn redocly split --separator / ./cypress/downloads/openapi-devtools-spec.yaml --outDir openapi
```

It will split the OpenAPI specification into multiple files in the `openapi` folder. You can use these files to generate client SDK and mock server and
it's simpler to maintain and extend for further development.

# Conclusion

In this blog post, I explained how to generate OpenAPI specification from end-to-end tests.
However, You can also record the network traffic with HAR files or the openapi-devtools extension manually.
If you are in rush, or you don't want to write end-to-end tests, you can record the network traffic manually and convert it to OpenAPI specification.
