## Introduction
I set up a Spotify now listening widget on my website and I thought it would be cool to have a similar widget for Steam.
I searched for a while and I found a [Steam API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API)
that can be used to get the current playing game. In this article,
I will show you how to show your current playing game from Steam on your website using NextJS and Steam API.

## Create NextJS project
First, we need to create a NextJS project. You can create it by running the following command.

```bash
npx create-next-app --ts
```

## Get Steam API Key
Now, you need to get a Steam API key. You can get it from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

> NOTE: If you haven't bought any game from Steam, you can't get a Steam API key.

## Get Your Steam ID
You can get your Steam ID from [here](https://steamidfinder.com/).

## Using Steam's API
Inside your NextJS project, create a file called `.env.local` and add `STEAM_API_KEY` and `STEAM_ID`
from the previous steps to it.

```bash
STEAM_API_KEY=YOUR_STEAM_API_KEY
STEAM_ID=YOUR_STEAM_ID
```

Then, create a file called `lib/steam.ts` and add the following code to it.

```ts
// It's better to have types in different file
export interface GetPlayerSummariesResponse {
  response: Response;
}

export interface Response {
  players: Player[];
}

export enum PersonaState {
  OFFLINE,
  ONLINE,
  BUSY,
  AWAY,
  SNOOZE,
  LOOKING_TO_TRADE,
  LOOKING_TO_PLAY,
}

export enum CommunityVisibilityState {
  PRIVATE = 1,
  PUBLIC = 2,
}

export enum ProfileState {
  NOT_CONFIGURED = 0,
  CONFIGURED = 1,
}

export interface Player {
  avatar: string;
  avatarfull: string;
  avatarhash: string;
  avatarmedium: string;
  communityvisibilitystate: CommunityVisibilityState;
  gameextrainfo: string;
  gameid: string;
  gameserverip: string;
  lastlogoff: number;
  loccityid: number;
  loccountrycode: string;
  locstatecode: string;
  personaname: string;
  personastate: PersonaState;
  personastateflags: number;
  primaryclanid: string;
  profilestate: ProfileState;
  profileurl: string;
  realname: string;
  steamid: string;
  timecreated: number;
}

const steamApiKey = process.env.STEAM_API_KEY!;
const steamId = process.env.STEAM_ID!;
const GET_PLAYER_SUMMARIES_ENDPOINT =
  "http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002";

export const getNowPlaying = async (): Promise<GetPlayerSummariesResponse> => {
  const url = new URL(GET_PLAYER_SUMMARIES_ENDPOINT);
  const params = {
    key: steamApiKey,
    steamids: steamId,
  };
  url.search = new URLSearchParams(params).toString();

  return fetch(url.toString()).then<GetPlayerSummariesResponse>((response) =>
    response.json(),
  );
};
```

## Create an API route

Now, we need to create an API route to get the current playing game.
Create a file called `app/api/steam/now-playing.ts` and add the following code to it.

> I'm using NextJS app router to create API routes.

```ts
import * as steamApi from "src/lib/steam";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export const runtime = "edge";
export const fetchCache = "force-no-store";

const GET = async () => {
  const headers = {
    "Cache-Control": `public, s-maxage=${60 * 5}, stale-while-revalidate=${60}`,
  };

  try {
    const response = await steamApi.getNowPlaying();

    if (!response.response.players[0])
      return NextResponse.json(
        {
          error: "No player found",
        },
        {
          status: 404,
        },
      );

    const playerData = response.response.players[0];

    const profileUrl = playerData.profileurl;
    const isPlaying = !!playerData?.gameid;
    const personName = playerData.personaname;
    const profileState = playerData.profilestate;
    const gameName = isPlaying ? playerData.gameextrainfo : null;
    const gameUrl = isPlaying
      ? `https://store.steampowered.com/app/${playerData.gameid}`
      : null;

    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        profileUrl,
        gameName,
        isPlaying,
        personName,
        profileState,
        gameUrl,
      },
      {
        status: 200,
        headers,
      },
    );
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        error,
      },
      {
        status: 500,
        headers,
      },
    );
  }
};

export { GET };
```

## Test the API route
Now, you can test the API route by running the following command.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/steam/now-playing
```

You should get a response like this.

```json
{
  "profileUrl": "https://steamcommunity.com/id/ali4heydari/",
  "gameName": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive",
  "isPlaying": true,
  "personName": "ali4heydari",
  "profileState": 1,
  "gameUrl": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/730"
}
```
