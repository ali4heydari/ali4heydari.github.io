## Overview

This project was a collaboration with [Lion Digital Solution](https://lionsds.com/). 
The goal was to create a dashboard that would allow Amazon sellers to view their sales data in a more intuitive way than the default Amazon Seller Central dashboard.
It used the [Amazon MWS API](https://developer.amazonservices.com/) to fetch data from Amazon, A cron job for scraping data that was not available through the API, 
A Chrome extension for scraping private data from the Amazon Seller Central dashboard, and a Django backend for storing and serving the data.
Unfortunately, the project had only private beta release and is no longer available.

## My Role
I was the sole developer on this project. I developed both dashboard and landing page, 
and was responsible for the entire development process from start to finish.
Also I worked on Chrome extension for scraping private data from the Amazon Seller Central dashboard.
