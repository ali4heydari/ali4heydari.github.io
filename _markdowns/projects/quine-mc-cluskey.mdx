![Quine McCluskey Solver](/static/images/_markdowns/projects/quine-mc-cluskey/cover.png)

This project is a desktop application developed as part of a Logic Circuits course. The application is designed to minimize boolean functions using the Quine McCluskey method.

The Quine McCluskey method is a technique used in digital logic design to simplify boolean expressions and reduce the number of terms in a logical function. It is an essential tool for optimizing logic circuits and improving their efficiency.

To explore the details of the project and access the source code, you can visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ali4heydari/QuineMcCluskey).

Feel free to explore the repository and learn more about the Quine McCluskey Solver application.
