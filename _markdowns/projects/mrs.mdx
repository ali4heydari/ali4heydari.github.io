## Overview
This project was developed for Ertebat Farda Company and is live at [mrs.efarda.ir](https://mrs.efarda.ir)
(Unfortunatly it is accessible only for Iran IPs 😒)
The main goal of this project is to provide a platform for merchants to report their sales and transactions.
I worked on both frontend and backend of this project.
The backend of this project is developed using dotnet core and the frontend is developed using React.
The frontend is a web application that is compatible with mobile devices and is developed using React and AntDesign.

I learned and used many design patterns and best practices in this project like
Circuit Breaker, Retry, Bulkhead, Factory, Repository, Unit of Work, Fasad, etc.

Also I learned to write a private nuget package and use it in my projects.

I also set up a monitoring system for this project using Prometheus and Grafana.
