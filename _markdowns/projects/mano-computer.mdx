## Overview

This project was developed as part of a Computer Architecture course. I simulated the Mano computer using Proteus 8, a software tool for electronic circuit design and simulation.

The Mano computer is a simple computer architecture that was introduced by Charles R. Mano. It serves as a fundamental example for understanding computer organization and architecture principles.

To explore the details of the project and access the source code, you can visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ali4heydari/ManoComputer).

Feel free to explore the repository and learn more about the simulation of the Mano computer architecture.
