In this project, our team was responsible for carrying out team coordination and work. We collaborated closely with hospital, clinic, and laboratory managers to gather requirements and perform data engineering.
The outcome of our efforts is the development of a follow-up automation software called Sina Heart. This software plays a crucial role in the process of discharging patients by enabling hospitals and clinics to stay in touch with their patients and coordinate their next check-ups. Additionally, it provides patients with educational content to support their ongoing care.
We are proud to share that Sina Heart is currently being used by Sina Hospital, making a positive impact on patient care and communication.
Feel free to explore the live demo to get a glimpse of the Sina Heart follow-up automation software.
