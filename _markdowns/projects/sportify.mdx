Sportify is a web development course project that aims to provide a simple site for football and basketball news. The project focuses on delivering up-to-date news and information about these popular sports.
As part of the web development course, our team worked on designing and developing the Sportify website. We aimed to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate and access the latest news articles, match updates, player profiles, and more.
To explore the details of the project and access the source code, you can visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ali4heydari/sportify-frontend).
