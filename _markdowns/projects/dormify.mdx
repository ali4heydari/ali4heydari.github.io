I had the opportunity to work on the Dormify project, where I was involved in various aspects of the development process. Some of my responsibilities and experiences include:

- Carrying out team coordination and work.
- Meeting with dormitory managers for requirements engineering and data gathering.
- Conducting scrum meetings (planning, daily stand-ups, etc.) using Microsoft Teams, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Designing and developing a software solution for managing dormitory operations, including ticketing, issue tracking, and guest invitation management.
- Implementing a fully dockerized and automated CI/CD pipeline to streamline the development process.

### Description of CI/CD

Our project consists of two packages: a common package containing reusable components and utilities, and the main package called student-panel. I designed a pipeline with three stages:

1. Build: This stage builds the project and generates the necessary artifacts.
2. Type Coverage: We used the [type-coverage package](https://github.com/plantain-00/type-coverage) to measure the TypeScript code coverage.
3. Test: This stage includes unit testing with Jest and end-to-end testing with Cypress.

After each build, we collect artifacts that include the build output, test results, code coverage reports, Cypress videos and screenshots, and type coverage results.
