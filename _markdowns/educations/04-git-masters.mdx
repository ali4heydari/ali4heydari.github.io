When I was Teacher assistant in University I needed to learn Git professionally.
Not only for teaching to my students but also for verifiying their homeworks.
My manager and CEO of Ertebat Farda Co. asked me to teach Git to our developers.
I decided to teach them Git in a workshop. I prepared a workshop for them and I taught them Git in 8 sessions.
I tried to teach them Git in practical way. I used Git in terminal and I taught them how to use Git in terminal.

Course content is available in the [Git Masters website](https://ali4heydari.github.io/git-masters/).
