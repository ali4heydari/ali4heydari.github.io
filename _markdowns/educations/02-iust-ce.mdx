I started my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology in 2017.
I only studied courses that I was interested in and I didn't take any courses that I didn't like. ðŸ¥´
That's why I didn't get a good GPA ðŸ¤« but I learned a lot of things that I'm still using them in my career.
Some of my paper homeworks are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ali4heydari/Spring2019UniHWsPDF)
